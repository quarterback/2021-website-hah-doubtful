    "description": "#### Work\n\nI lead cross-functional teams and work on impactful, people-focused design products and initiatives. I help governments (and companies) devise manage large-scale digital transformation. For nearly three years, I've worked on some of the world's biggest problems as part of [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), an innovation product office within the federal government where I currently manage the product design team. Previously,  my work included product strategy & digital transformation for complex institutions; [CMS migrations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REUJCWpFOcI), information architecture, user research & service design. \n\nThese days, my practice is focused on interrogating the ways harm is crafted into everyday experiences, and examining new ways for building teams, frameworks, and mental models for reducing friction that ruins experience, centered around a set of principles called *[Consequence Design](https://consequence.design/post/616408785711431680/on-consequence-design)*.\n\n#### Coaching & Community building\n\nI've also speak globally at world-class design, UX & tech events like An Event Apart, Confab, and many others. I've run a bevy of events including conferences of my own, too. When I don't have a mic in my hand, I'm holding a tennis racquet. I've been a coach for collegiate, high school, and private camps around the country.  I'm the girls varsity head coach for a private high school in Portland.\n\n#### Miscellanea\n\nSometimes, people have only heard of me because of my [music recs](https://www.last.fm/user/omnivoreron), or want to talk about the time I had a tea brand, ran a startup shoe company, or once unwittingly becoming an American emissary for the Finnish version of baseball, [Pes√§pallo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_navSFGj0I) Or maybe you're a gym teacher curious about playing [Tennis Polo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_polo) in your class. In any case, [feel free to say hi](mailto:ronald.bronson@pm.me)."
